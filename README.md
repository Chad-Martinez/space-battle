# SPACE BATTLE v2.2

Space Battle is a simple javascript game built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS/SASS as part of a lab during my time at Per Scholas. It pays homage to Season 2 Episode 3 (When Aliens Attack) of Futurama.

Designed for a 1080 screen size.

Episode Storyline:
The Omicrons threaten to destroy the earth if they can't see the last episode of a lost 20th Century television series "Single Female Lawyer" starring an unmarried human female, who wears very short miniskirts, struggling to succeed in a human man's world. Because the last episode was destroyed by someone spilling beer on the transmitter (Fry), the crew from Planet Express must deliver their version of "Single Female Lawyer."

## Choose your captain: 

Captain Turanga Leela: For better or worse, the ship runs on her high octane passions, because of her longing for family, her love of violence, her commitment to a job well done, or her affection for animals. 

Captain Zapp Brannigan: Although Zapp Brannigan is considered a great military hero by many people, most who have met him are less impressed by his goofy, arrogant, incompetent, perverted, phallic, selfish, mean-spirited, egotistical, cowardly, chauvinistic, bossy, cocky, manipulative, supremely vain personality, as well as his incredible stupidity.

## Choose your ship:

Planet Express:
The pride and joy of Planet Express Corp. It is a lean, mean delivery machine.  It has a hull shield of 20, firepower strength of 4, and an accuracy rating of 70%

Nimbus:
The flagship of the Democratic Order of Plants (DOOP) star fleet under the command of 25-Star General Zapp Brannigan. It has a hull shield of 30, firepower strength of 6, and an accurarcy rating of 50%.

Choose your ship wisely!

Good luck Captain!
